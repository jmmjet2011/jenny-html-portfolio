<h1>The Best Movies According to Jenny</h1>
<h2>Jenny's Top 3 Movie Picks</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Passion of the Christ</h3>
<p>This movie is completly in Latin, Aramaic, and Hebrew with English subtitles. The movie depicts the final 12 hours of Jesus' life, the day of his crucifiction in Jerusalem. I feel the movie really captures the pain and weight of Jesus' sacrifice for human kind. I LOVE this movie!</p>
<h3>Disney's Beauty and the Beast (1992)</h3>
<p>I loved this movie growing up. Although as an adult I see it in a different light, I still love the message of the movie (which is to value inward characteristics over superficial qualities). </p>
<h3>Dirty Dancing</h3>
<p>Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey had great chemistry in this movie (although not so much in real life). My favorite scene is when Swayze says, "Nobody puts Baby in the corner".</p>
