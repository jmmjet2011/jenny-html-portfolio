<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>Hello, I'm Jenny Mena. I'd like to share why I chose to pursue a career in Web Development. 
  For years, I taught at the elementary school level before transitioning into higher education as a retention specialist and academic advisor. 
  It was during this time that one of my advisees expressed her passion for Web Development, sparking my interest.</p>

<p>Curious, I immersed myself into the world of web development through YouTube videos, albeit with some initial hesitation. 
  Despite feeling intimidated, one evening I talked with my husband about my interest in web development, even though I doubted my 
  ability to succeed in such a challenging field, especially against younger competition. His encouragement led me to reach out 
  to a friend of his who works in web development. </p>

<p>That conversation provided the push I needed. Fast forward to today, I've navigated through learning curves, frustrations, and moments 
  of self-doubt while juggling work, parenting, and other responsibilities. Yet, I'm proud to have achieved my goal. 
  Despite the bumps along the way, I'm excited about stepping into the field of web development and continuing to learn more and more.
  I can't wait to see what lies ahead.</p>
